# Intro
This is yet another webscraper - this time it'll use the (not so hidden) API for Primark to scrape results from their site, and host it on a locally hosted website.
# Installation
The usual `yarn` to install the packages
# Running
1. In root directory, start the webserver `node ./backend/index.js`
2. In `client` directory, host the GUI `yarn start`
